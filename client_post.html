                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For my project, I am working with Penelope and Mark. Our goal was to create an assistive device for a cat. Our customer profile with this was a person who owns a cat, likely disabled in some way. Over the course of their day, our device would either assist the cat or the owner in some way. Whether it be assistance with walking, eating, or taking medication. We decided to find a client, through a Brandeis alumnus. Professor Hinkley-Boltax is a veterinary professor at Tufts, and so we decided to reach out to her. We used our knowledge, and advice from Professor Ian, to draft an email. Below is a list of questions we kept in mid, and the first email we sent to Professor Hinkley-Boltax.</p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/questions.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/email.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For our first meeting, we prepared an example of an eating assistive device, as well as a very simple prosthetic. When we met with her, she didn’t love our ideas about prosthetics. She didn’t find them feasible to do as students in the amount of time we had. We proposed the idea of an assistive device for megaesophagus, an eating disability in dogs (and some cats), and this seemed to spark her interest more. We talked about the possibility of us creating a Bailey Chair for cats and dogs, which is a device that helps dogs and cats with megaesophagus eat. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> We then went through and did two different design thinking methodologies. The first one was an exercise to see what pet owners need. We started with many ideas, and then narrowed it down. It is shown below  </p>
                             <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/exercise1.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                             <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/exercise2.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> We decided to go with the feeding idea because it seems the most doable for us, and it was the idea that we discussed with the professor. We then did a second methodology to help us empathize with cats more and understand their needs better. This one is shown below. </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/exercise3.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lastly, we identified 5 potential solutions to issues involving cats. The professor helped us brainstorm these, as we didn’t know every one of them was an issue. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">   1.  An insulin pen that would help owners inject their cats with insulin. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">   2.  A device to help owners with the operation of a syringe.  </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">   3.  A device that would help owners feed their cats pills orally.  </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">   4.  Something that would assist owners into getting their pets safely into a carrier.  </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">   5.  Bailey Chairs to help pets eat their food upright.  </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">While we were unable to find a specific client at the moment, Professor Hinkley-Boltax told us it would be helpful to make different sized Bailey chairs and donate them to an animal hospital to be given to low-income individuals who could not afford them otherwise. We also will put our design as an open-source resource online, so that anyone who wants to make their own is able. Bailey Chairs are not currently something that is 3D printed, but if we put our design online, this could potentially be something that is helpful to many people.  </p>
