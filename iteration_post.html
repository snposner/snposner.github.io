                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We decided last time that we would be making Bailey Chairs for animals with megaesophagus. We hope to donate multiple sizes of these chairs to our client at Tufts, and hopefully they will be donated to animals in need. For our needs statements: the client needs different sizes of chairs to donate to their patients, so that owners of pets who can’t normally afford Bailey Chairs are able to feed their pets healthily. These chairs need to be strong so that they can hold the weight of the animals without breaking. There is also a need for open-source material on the internet for this, as it doesn’t currently exist. It needs to be adjustable, so that the users are able to adjust it to the dimensions of their pet. We, the designers, will make sure to incorporate all of these needs into our design process and final project. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We found an example of a Bailey chair online, from an article (link: https://learn.kregtool.com/plans/bailey-chair-for-dogs/). This article explained how to build a Bailey Chair from plywood. This gave us a basic idea of how to shape our bailey chair and what it should look like. The basic design we got from the website is shown below.</p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/site.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We then made a simple recreation of this in fusion360. We did this without any parameters, as we just wanted to see how it would come out and how it would work printed. When we printed it out, we used all the default print settings, except we added organic tree supports for the food dish. This first iteration is shown below.</p>
                             <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/I1.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> While it looks pretty good, and it looks like the proportions were good, we realized that the walls were very thin and flimsy. This was due to the fact that we scaled it down to be printed fairly small, just to see how it would come out. For the next iteration, we made it larger and also increased the thickness of the walls to make it more sturdy. We also added parameters, so that it is easily adjustable. The article we looked at earlier used three measurements to adjust the size of the chair for each dog. I ended up adding these three and even more parameters to make it more customizable. I added a parameter for the foot height, for the thickness of the material, and for the size of the bowl. Again, we printed with the default settings except for organic tree supports. It ended up coming out really well, the photo is shown below. </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/I2.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We realized that PLA might not always the most ideal material, as it isn’t very strong. We wanted to start looking into using wood, as we thought this would be stronger. We laser cut all the pieces of the Bailey Chair from wood and glued them together. We also added supports below the food dish, as we realized from previous iterations that the food dish was not very stable. The picture of our wood iteration is shown below. </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/I3.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This iteration turned out okay, but had some obvious flaws. The method of putting it together with glue is messy and isn’t very strong. We talked through multiple options for solving this, such as support brackets and screws, or making joints that can be screwed in. For now, we decided to try and make joints without these. This was mainly the focus of Mark. He decided to focus on creating arm joints in order to fit the pieces together. It took a few tries, but he was able to get the fit right and it worked! Below are the pictures of this.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This iteration probably was the biggest change, as it was the most difficult. We also probably learned the most from this iteration as well. Next week, we hope to make the Bailey Chair adjustable so that clients are able to change the size even after it is created. </p>
